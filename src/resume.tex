\section{Summary}\label{sec:resume}

Congratulations !! You just finished the workshop !\\

You can now try to create other resources to be more familiar with the Taikun Crossplane provider.\\

Here are some interesting links that can be useful:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The provider documentation: \href{https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/itera-io/provider-jet-taikun}{https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/itera-io/provider-jet-taikun}.
    \item Taikun documentation: \href{https://itera.gitbook.io/taikun/}{https://itera.gitbook.io/taikun/}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{note}
To delete a resource you just have to run
\begin{shell}
kubectl delete -f path-to-resource.yaml
\end{shell}
or
\begin{shell}
kubectl delete crd-name resource-name
\end{shell}
Sometimes the deletion can take many seconds to many minutes according to the resource.
\end{note}
