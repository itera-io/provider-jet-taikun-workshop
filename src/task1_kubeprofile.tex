\subsection{Task 1: Kubernetes Profile}\label{sec:kubeprofile}

\begin{note}
For this task, please write your code in the file \texttt{kubeprofile.yaml}
at the root of the \texttt{workshop/} directory.
\end{note}

Now that you have created an organization,
you will create a Kubernetes profile belonging to it.
Check the kubernetes profile resource's schema on
the provider's documentation in the \texttt{docs/} directory in the 
\href{https://github.com/itera-io/provider-jet-taikun/}{provider repository}.
and declare the resource in \texttt{kubernetesprofile.yaml}.
Set \texttt{organizationId} to the ID of the organization created in the previous task (see \fullref{sec:organization}).


\begin{tip}
To find the ID of the organization, run
\begin{shell}
watch kubectl get managed
\end{shell}
Then you should get the \texttt{EXTERNAL-NAME} of the \texttt{myorg} organization.
\begin{raw}
NAME                                                      READY SYNCED EXTERNAL-NAME AGE
organization.organization.taikun.jet.crossplane.io/myorg  True  True   14236         15s
\end{raw}
So here the organization ID will be \texttt{14236}.
\end{tip}

Feel free to set some of kubernetes profile's other optional attributes,
such as \texttt{scheduleOnMaster} and \\ \texttt{loadBalancingSolution}.


Once you have declared your resource, apply and move on to the next task.
